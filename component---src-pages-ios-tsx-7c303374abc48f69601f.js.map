The objective of IO1 is to deliver a\n                    blueprint of how to include testing in an early stage of\n                    programming education. Here the TILE approach (Test Informed\n                    Learning with Examples) is developed that implicitly teaches\n                    testing by providing a certain teaching style, sample\n                    lecture slides and assignments that stimulate students to\n                    test their code, e.g., by demonstrating testing subliminally\n                    in lectures or pointing out meaningful test data. In IO2 a\n                    procedural guidance is developed that can be applied when\n                    developing and testing is taught more explicitly. The\n                    developed procedure explains how to arrive at well tested\n                    code starting from an informal specification of the required\n                    functionality, and it is accompanied by exemplified lecture\n                    notes and fully worked-out sample assignments. The concepts\n                    of the TILE approach related to arriving at meaningful test\n                    cases can also be found in certain steps of the procedural\n                    guidance. IO3 is concerned with developing tools to\n                    automatically generate feedback regarding the quality of\n                    student solutions. This includes the correctness and\n                    completeness of the solution (an indicator of how well it\n                    was tested) as well as a direct assessment of the tests\n                    written by students. The feedback tools developed here can\n                    be especially used for the sample assignments developed in\n                    IO1 and IO2 and are particularly suitable to check for the\n                    learning objectives of the TILE approach and the procedural\n                    guidance. Finally, IO4 evaluates the QPED project as a\n                    whole. In this IO, existing university courses are adapted\n                    to include the results of all three IOs. Furthermore,\n                    measurement tools such as diagnostic assignments, rubrics\n                    and questionnaires are developed to assess the students'\n                    level regarding the learning objectives of the different IOs\n                    and the QPED project as a whole, and to compare these levels\n                    before and after the material and tools developed in the IOs\n                    have been used in the respective courses.\n                </Typography>\n                <Typography variant=\"h4\" align=\"center\" gutterBottom>\n                    Intellectual Outputs\n                </Typography>\n                <Typography color=\"textSecondary\" gutterBottom>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>\n                            <a href=\"/io1\">Intellectual Output 1: TILE</a>\n                        </li>\n                        <li>\n                            <a href=\"/io2\">\n                                Intellectual Output 2: Procedural Guidance\n                            </a>\n                        </li>\n                        <li>\n                            <a href=\"/io3\">\n                                Intellectual Output 3: Feedback Tools\n                            </a>\n                        </li>\n                        <li>\n                            <a href=\"/io4\">Intellectual Output 4: Evaluation</a>\n                        </li>\n                    </ul>\n                </Typography>\n            </Container>\n            <Footer />\n        </ThemeProvider>\n    );\n}\n"],"names":["Index","_jsxs","ThemeProvider","theme","children","_jsx","CssBaseline","Helmet","htmlAttributes","lang","charSet","name","content","rel","href","Header","HomeImage","title","Container","id","maxWidth","component","sx","paddingTop","paddingLeft","paddingRight","paddingBottom","Typography","color","gutterBottom","variant","align","Footer"],"sourceRoot":""}
