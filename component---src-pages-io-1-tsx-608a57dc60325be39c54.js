For example, students can easier accept that testing is part of writing software, the design and implementation of software improves, software is easier to test, and it encourages students to more carefully read the assignments. Unfortunately, many drawbacks still exist, resulting in introductory programming courses that are, even today, being taught without testing. For example, the negative attitude of students towards testing, and most programming courses are already fully packed. To help educators to improve this situation, we developed the TILE approach: Test Informed Learning with Examples.
